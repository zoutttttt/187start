# LTE-OFDM-SYSTEM

Here, we simulate an entire Transmission, Channel and Receiver chain for LTE OFDM system in Matlab using 3GPP specifications.
We use QPSK for pilot signals and 16QAM for data, and simulate both AWGN and Rayleigh channels.

A black and white Image is sent as data to the OFDM system and the resuting Bit Error Rates for different Signal to Noise ratio are examined using plots.

Please run OFDM_MAIN to run the simulation.
